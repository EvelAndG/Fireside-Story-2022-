    <p>It was a dark and stormy night...</p>
    <p>You stand soaking wet at the foot of a tall hill. Atop the hill stands a great mansion. Lightning strikes just behind the mansion. <i>So cliche right?</i></p>
    <p>The sound of the undead can be heard shambling in the distance. The mansion must be the source for all of this.</p>
    <p>Fight or flight? Do you go and find these undead and make them dead again or do you run and find help?</p>
    <p>Our hero had no fear, he decided to go it alone as he knew no one else was up to the task.</p>
    <p>Muscles tensed and the trek towards the sound of the undead began.</p>
